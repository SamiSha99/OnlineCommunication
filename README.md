Expand your Online Party experience by improving your ways to communicate with others.

Ping a spot! Tell others an interesting point. Emote to talk to them and everyone else, whether to say HI!, PECK!, BOOP! or to show your colorful stickers.

Announce your achievements by playing the game, from collecting a time piece to beating a hard deathwish to even that you were responsible for claiming the victory in Vanessa's Curse!

Completely customizable mod to fit your needs in many different situations:
* Changing the color of your ping, chat name and highlighters.
* Language Packages (requires 3rd party mod) see [Translation Support](https://github.com/SamiSha99/OnlineCommunication/wiki/Translation-Support) for more info.
* Communication Privacy.
* Streamer Mode.
* Color Blindness Mode.
