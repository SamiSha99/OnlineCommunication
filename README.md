Expand your Online Party experience by improving your ways to communicate with others.

Ping a spot! Tell others an interesting point. Emote to talk to them and everyone else, whether to say HI!, PECK!, BOOP! or to show your colorful stickers.

Announce your achievements by playing the game, from collecting a time piece to beating a hard deathwish to even that you were responsible for claiming the victory in Vanessa's Curse!

Completely customizable mod to fit your needs in many different situations:
* Changing the color of your ping, chat name and highlighters.
* Language Packages (requires 3rd party mod) see [Translation Support](https://github.com/SamiSha99/OnlineCommunication/wiki/Translation-Support) for more info.
* Communication Privacy.
* Streamer Mode.
* Color Blindness Mode.

## Notice

* This mod is exclusive to the Steam version of A Hat in Time due to it's usage of [Steam Networking API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer/networking) as it was [explained by Gears for Breakfast](https://support.hatintime.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021915254-How-was-Online-Party-achieved).
* This repository is only available for educational purposes and showcase, it is NOT functional to run because it's missing a file named `SS_PingSystem_Private` which is `.gitignore`-d for safety reasons, if you want to implement content to the mod, please contact via GitHub Issues, Discord via [A Hat in Time Discord](https://discord.gg/AHatinTime) (friend requests are disabled for everyone) or read the [Wiki](https://github.com/SamiSha99/OnlineCommunication/wiki) to see how it works
